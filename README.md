# Machine Learning Case Studies

## Content

* [Payment Fraud Detection](/Payment_Fraud_Detection)
  - build and deploy a supervised, LinearLearner model in SageMaker. You'll tune a model and handle a case of class imbalance to train a model to detect cases of credit card fraud.
* [Plagiarism Detection](/Plagiarism_Detection)
- Build an end-to-end plagiarism classification model. Apply your skills to clean data, extract meaningful features, and deploy a plagiarism classifier in SageMaker.

* [Population Segmentation](/Population_Segmentation)
- build and deploy unsupervised models in SageMaker. In this example, you'll cluster US Census data; reducing the dimensionality of data using PCA and the clustering the resulting, top components with k-means.

* [Sentiment analysis](/Sentiment-analysis-Sagemaker)
- 
* [Time Series forecasting](/Time_Series_Forecasting)
- analyze time series data and format it for training a DeepAR algorithm; a forecasting algorithm that utilizes a recurrent neural network. Train a model to predict household energy consumption patterns and evaluate the results.

# Machine Learning Case Studies

## Content

* [Payment Fraud Detection](/Payment_Fraud_Detection)
  Build and deploy a supervised, LinearLearner model in SageMaker. You'll tune a model and handle a case of class imbalance to train a model to detect cases of credit card fraud.
  
* [Plagiarism Detection](/Plagiarism_Detection)
  Build an end-to-end plagiarism classification model. Apply your skills to clean data, extract meaningful features, and deploy a plagiarism classifier in SageMaker.

* [Population Segmentation](/Population_Segmentation) 
  Build and deploy unsupervised models in SageMaker. In this example, you'll cluster US Census data; reducing the dimensionality of data using PCA and the clustering the resulting, top components with k-means.

* [Sentiment analysis](/Sentiment-analysis-Sagemaker)
  The project is to deploy a RNN model performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint. This project assumes that you have some familiarity with SageMaker. Completing the XGBoost Sentiment Analysis notebook should suffice.

* [Time Series forecasting](/Time_Series_Forecasting)
  Analyze time series data and format it for training a DeepAR algorithm; a forecasting algorithm that utilizes a recurrent neural network. Train a model to predict household energy consumption patterns and evaluate the results.
